This project is a ToDo List that has various basic necessities such as creating/viewing projects, creating/viewing todo tasks for each individual project, editing/deleting project and task objects, and much more.

This project is bundled together using webpack, which is necessary in coordinating various Javascript modules together in serving their purpose, as each individual module follows the 'Single Responsibility Principle' based on the SOLID Principle framework. 

The project also utilizes local storage, allowing user created projects and tasks to be saved locally on the user's device.
